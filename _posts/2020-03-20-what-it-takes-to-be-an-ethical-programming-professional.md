For most programmers and software engineering professionals, a love of technology, logic, and problem-solving serve as primary motivators. As a result, we can’t resist taking on complex projects that would drive others mad. What results is a kind of myopia that is unique to people in the software industry; a single-minded pursuit of solutions that means we don’t always take the time to think about the long-term ethical ramifications of the code we produce.

That’s a bigger issue than you might imagine. In today’s world, software is involved in almost every part of our lives. It manages the complex supply chains that put food on our supermarket shelves. It helps first responders figure out how to reach us when there’s an emergency. It even makes decisions that can affect our very freedom to walk the streets.

As programmers, we don’t give those things much thought as we do our work and understandably so. They’re issues that seem far above our pay grade. But the reality is that every line of code we create has consequences, and they can be severe. For evidence, look no further than the apparent control software flaws that doomed two of Boeing’s 737 Max jets–claiming 346 lives.

It’s easy to argue that a situation like that one resulted from a cascade of failures that were the fault of the whole organization–and that’s certainly true.

It’s also easy for the average independent programmer to dismiss the scenario as something that doesn’t apply to them, since they don’t work for companies producing software with life-or-death stakes, and that could be true as well.

But when you consider that some of the software in question may have originated at an outsourced programming firm that didn’t have the necessary expertise for the work, it starts becoming clear that we, as an industry, can’t afford to keep passing the buck. There’s no way to know when we’ll be faced with making a decision about the ethics involved in something we’re working on.

For that reason, it’s important for all programmers, developers, and software engineers to take steps to define some ethical boundaries in advance. We, as an industry, have to seek out the right knowledge and decide where we draw the line between earning our pay and sleeping well at night. Here are some tips on where to begin that journey and how to make sure to be an ethical programming professional.
